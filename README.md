# Machine Learning Associative Memory

Code used in "Neural network based associative memory"
Main goal of the text is to compare three associative memory models beased on minimizing neural networks' energy function:
  1. Classic Hopfield network
  2. Dense associative memory
  3. Modern Hopfield network (HopfieldLayer)
