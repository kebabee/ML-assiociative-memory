# Machine Learning Associative Memory

Some of the code used in [Implementation of associative memory models using neural networks](https://github.com/kebabee/ML-assiociative-memory/blob/main/neural_network_associative_memory.pdf).

Main goal of the text is to compare three associative memory models beased on minimizing neural networks' energy function:
  1. Classic Hopfield network
  2. Dense associative memory
  3. Modern Hopfield network (HopfieldLayer)
